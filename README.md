npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

## Highlights

- This is one of my very first projects I completed when I first learned VueJS.
- A todo app can only do what it is supposed to do: saving activities, helping sort the list, marking the complete jobs and getting rid of unwanted jobs.
- Storing data on Firestore in this app is pretty overkill, but it helped me learn to connect between the UI and the backbone of the web app - the database.
- It was also the first time I know how to host the website on a particular backend service, so it was fun.
